## Goals 🗺️

Some time ago, I was interested on Typescript and building APIs with it, so I started a [NestJs course](https://github.com/kammradt/learning-nestjs). This project aims to apply what I learned, by creating a an API to a _[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) clone_ that I'm calling **Let's meet!**

## Description 📝

**Let's meet!** is a study project aiming to be a simpler version of [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/).

It will allow users to create, manage and organize events.
You can verify more below!

## How to use :globe_with_meridians:

API: https://api-lets-meet.herokuapp.com/ - [API repo](https://github.com/kammradt/lets-meet-api)  
Web app: https://lets-meet.now.sh/

## How to use :house:

### Vue setup

Recommended TSC version: `Version 3.9.3`
Recommended Node version: `v12.16.3`
(It is easier to install using [nvm!](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

- Installing Node and Typescript:
	```bash
	$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
	$ nvm install v12.16.3
	$ npm install -g typescript
	```

  > Vue has an amazing CLI tool, it is a good idea to install it!

- Installing Vue CLI:

  ```bash
  $ npm install -g @vue/cli
  ```

- Development:

  ```bash
  npm run serve
  ```

- Production:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

##  Help is always welcome :wink:
> Because as you can see, I have absolute no ideia what I'm doing :satisfied:

### How can I help?
- You can [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this project and modify what you want. And then, send modifications using the [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) system.

### What is and How to create a Fork?
- A Fork is basically a copy of this repository, but in your account. So, you have access to all files and can do whatever you want with your version.
Using github is really easy to create a Fork, just follow:
> You just need to click on `Fork` button on the top right!
![Fork instructions](https://github.com/kammradt/lets-meet-client/blob/master/images/fork.gif)

### What is and How to create a Pull Request?
- A Pull Request is a way of putting code from multiple people together in a organized way. After your modifications on your own forked repository, you can commit those changes and push to it.
Now you have you repository updated with changes, but note that all those changes are only on your forked version.
How to put your version together with mine and have a better project? Really easy! Just follow:
> 1. Go to the Pull Request tab
> 2. Click on `new pull Request`
> 3. You can verify the modifications
> 4. Click on `Create pull Request`
> 5. It is a good ideia to write a description of what was added
> 5. Create it! Thanks so much!
